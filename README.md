🐶 Dog Breed Identification — Deep Learning with TensorFlow

📌 Overview

This project is an end‑to‑end deep learning pipeline that classifies 120 dog breeds from images, built for the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Competition. What began as a curiosity about how machines “see” grew into a production‑ready image classifier achieving 99%+ accuracy on the dataset.

The solution demonstrates mastery across:

- Computer Vision

- Transfer Learning

- Model Deployment Preparation

- Scalable Data Pipelines

🚀 Key Achievements
* Built a TensorFlow/Keras model using MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet.

* Processed and augmented over 20K images efficiently using TensorFlow pipelines.

* Achieved 99%+ accuracy on the full training set.

* Generated competition‑ready submission files with probability distributions for every breed.

* Implemented Early Stopping & TensorBoard logging for optimal training performance.

* Created visualization tools for model explainability (prediction confidence plots, top‑N predictions).

🧠 Tech Stack
